                    <strong>Sagana is a decentralized financial inclusion app
                    built for farmers and fisherfolks,</strong> designed to provide a secure and
                    transparent way to save, earn rewards, and manage finances through
                    the power of Base blockchain. It seeks to address the long-standing
                    challenges of financial access in rural communities by introducing
                    modern digital solutions that transform traditional cash handling
                    into opportunities for growth and stability.
